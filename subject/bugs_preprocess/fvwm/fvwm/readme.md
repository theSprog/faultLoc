This is a description of all the parameters of the related code,
the Arabic numbers represent the index of one parameter within a test case,
followed by the characters representing the names of the parameters,
such as `i: NAME` representing the name of i-th parameter is **NAME** 


for the `.csv` and `.safe` files, we define the value of each parameter to be 1 for the 'n' and 2 for the 'y'
and for the `.fault` files, each block of file separated by '#' represent one complete fault parameter-value pairs
such as `k: v` representing there is a part of fault when k-th parameter take 'v'
and if you assign all the parameters within a block to the corresponding values, you will get an fault
